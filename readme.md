# ROS Navigation Stack
This repo is needed for the motion planning repo. Pulled in so I can refactor things where I want.


**Please visit [morisbots' website](https://moribots.github.io/project/ekfslam) for the theory behind this project**

## Project Overview
This totally-from-scratch project involved modeling a `Turtlebot3` in Gazebo and using `Differential Drive Kinematics` to perform Odometry calculations. The `Gazebo Plugin` was developed to emulate the low-level interface on the real Turtlebot3 for the ability to develop high-fidelity code in simulation. I also implemented `landmark detection` on the Turtlebot3's `LIDAR`, and used these features to perform `EKF SLAM` with `Unknown Data Association`.

The core project components are:

* [rigid2d](rigid2d/): library containing 2D Lie Group operations for Transforms, Vectors and Twists as well as differential drive robot kinematics for odometry updates.
* [nuturtle_description](nuturtle_description/): houses the description of a differential drive robot with a caster wheel for support.
* [nuturtle_robot](nuturtle_robot/): interfaces with the real Turtlebot3's low-level controls such as setting wheel speeds and reading sensors.
* [nuturtle_gazebo](nuturtle_gazebo/): contains a Gazebo Plugin to emulate the Turtlebot3's low-level controls in Gazebo for the ability to develop in simulation.
* [nuslam](nuslam/): library containing LIDAR feature detection methods and EKF SLAM implementation with Unknown Data Association.

Please navigate to the respective directories for a detailed description of each component.

## Quickstart Guide

Use the [nuturtle.rosinstall](nuturtle.rosinstall) file to get all the necessary files and packages. This will download some custom Gazebo worlds as well as morisbots' `rigid2d` and `ekf` libraries.

You should consult the [Documentation](https://moribots.github.io/turtlebot3_from_scratch/) for details on how to use the `classes` and `methods` in this navigation stack.
